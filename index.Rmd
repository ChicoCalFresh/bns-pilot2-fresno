### Pilot #2: Fresno State Specific Trends in Basic Needs

Food insecurity among college students is a serious problem that can impact student performance in the classroom and ultimately effect student success. The [Center for Healthy Communities](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/) (CHC) developed the **Basic Needs Student Success Survey (BNS3)** and administered it to 402 undergraduate students participating in the [Educational Opportunity Program (EOP)](https://www2.calstate.edu/attend/student-services/eop) at [Chico State](https://www.csuchico.edu/eop/) (n=145), [Fresno State](https://www.fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/eop/abouteop.html) (n=134) and [CSU, Northridge](https://www.csun.edu/csun-eop) (n=123) from November 25th, 2020 to March 24th, 2021. This website shows the results specific to the Fresno State campus. To see the combined campus trends for all three campuses, click here [_See combined campus trends here_](). The EOP office assisted in the recruitment and participants were given a \$25 gift card for completing the survey. EOP students were identified as the target population for this survey based upon their low-income and first-generation student status, which indicates a higher probability of CalFresh eligibility.

The purpose of this second cross-sectional pilot study was to revise the BNS3 tool and assess student perception of the following:  

1. The impact of receiving [CalFresh](https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/index.shtml) assistance.
2. The impact of utilization of the campus food pantry on their health, nutrition, cooking
confidence, time management and academic performance. 

Researchers and campus staff are encouraged to review the information in this analysis to formulate additional research questions and hypotheses.

**Disclaimer on Missing Data:** Students were allowed to select answers such as "Prefer not to answer" or "I don't know" as responses to every question asked. These answers were then converted to missing values, denoted as *NA*, and this is the cause of the missing data for certain questions (not 100% of respondents reporting). The total number of non-missing responses (and percentage of the total data) are provided for each question.
